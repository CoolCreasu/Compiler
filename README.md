# Compiler

---

## How to use?

The release is a simple console app that asks for 2 inputs.  
the first input you give it is a path to the file written in the TeenyTiny language. (e.g. "c:/code/Hello.tiny" without the quotes!)
the second input is the path where you want the code output. (e.g. "C:/code/output.c" without the quotes!)
