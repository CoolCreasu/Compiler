# Compiler

Compiler from a tutorial in python that i tried to recreate in C#  
The tutorial by Austin Z. Henley: https://austinhenley.com/blog/teenytinycompiler1.html  
His Github repository: https://github.com/AZHenley/teenytinycompiler  

This is now a complete version made i C#
If you want you can always do a pull request to contribute code or adjust the code for readability.

I am not planning on adding stuff to this, i mostly did this to see how hard/easy it is to convert code from a different language.  
If you want you can always make a pull request to add code yourself tho, if it works i will merge it.
